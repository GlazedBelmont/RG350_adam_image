    1. Check the [FAQ](https://github.com/eduardofilo/RG350_adam_image/wiki/En:-7.-FAQ) and [Problem solving](https://github.com/eduardofilo/RG350_adam_image/wiki/En:-6.-Problem-solving) documents on the wiki to see if the problem you observed is already solved or has a known workaround.
    2. If it is more of a question than a problem, consider opening a [Discussion](https://github.com/eduardofilo/RG350_adam_image/discussions) post instead of opening an Issue.
    3. Think about whether the issue is with the image itself or with one of the pieces of software it contains (ODBeta, RetroArch, SimpleMenu, emulators).
    4. The software contained in the image is mostly homebrew and not perfect. Consider whether your request makes sense considering the situation.
    5. The image brings together the work of many people who have put in many hours of effort. If you encounter an issue that you have the capacity to solve on your own, consider taking some time to contribute with the solution to the collective work.
